Here's what it does:

- Encryption: Users can input a message and a shift value to convert their text into an encrypted format.

- Decryption: The program also allows users to revert the encrypted text back to its original form using the same shift value.

What is a Shift Value?

The shift value is a key component of the Caesar Cipher. It determines how many positions each letter in the text is shifted along the alphabet. For example, with a shift value of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on. This simple yet effective method ensures that the text is transformed into a coded message.

This project not only enhanced my understanding of basic cryptographic techniques but also honed my Python programming skills. üêçüíª
